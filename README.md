## Cancer Bioinformatician and Data Scientist

I have spent over 9 years working in the academic research setting. I have a strong data analytical background and extensive experience in analysing quantitative data resulting from a wide variety of technologies including next-generation sequencing, microarray, NanoString nCounter and high-throughput RT-qPCR array profiling platforms, amongst various others.

I am skilled in development and deployment of scalable, automated cloud-based or high-performance computing (HPC) workflows, as well as being proficient in acquiring, cleaning and wrangling data from a broad range of sources, undertaking exploratory data analyses, using descriptive and inferential statistical methods and best-practice data visualisation techniques.

I am currently a member of the <a href="https://sbc.shef.ac.uk./" target="_blank">Sheffield Bioinformatics Core</a> working on a project aiming to create a mutational map of non-coding genomic regions for the 100,000 Genome Project for bladder cancer and contributing bioinformatics capability to the Genotype of Urothelial cancer (GUSTO) clinical trial. I am involved in assessing, testing, and implementing best practice methods for genomic data analysis, as well as contributing to the maintenance of well-curated, highly structured, transparent resources for integrating genomic and clinical data.

As part of my current role, I provide custom analyses and deliver data, results and reports detailing quality control and analysis procedures carried out in secure containerised environments to users of the Sheffield Bioinformatics Core Facility. I am involved in supporting the provision of best-practice training and workshops in bioinformatics techniques and next-generation sequencing activities to laboratory scientists. I also assist and guide investigators across the university in statistically sound experimental design, interpretation of results, and grant or manuscript writing where this requires extensive bioinformatics input.
